      To expatiate on the advantages of printing, at this time of
      day, would be "wasteful and ridiculous excess." We content
      ourselves with the comparison of Dryden's
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          "Long trails of light descending down."

    </div>
    <p>
      In a retrospective glance at our previous volumes (for can
      the phrenologists tell us of a head capacious enough to
      contain their exhaustless variety?) our readers will perceive
      that, from time to time, sundry "accounts" of the origin and
      progress of printing have been inserted in the
      MIRROR;<a id="footnotetag1"
      name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
      and though we are not vain enough to consider our sheet as
      the "refined gold, the lily, the violet, the ice, or the
      rainbow," of the poet's perfection, yet in specimens of the
      general <i>economy of the art</i>, the long-extended
      patronage of the public gives us an early place.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an outline of the life of CAXTON our readers must be
      already familiar; but we wish them to consider the above
      accurate representation of the FIRST ENGLISH PRINTER'S
      RESIDENCE as antecedent to a <i>Memoir of Caxton</i>, in
      which it will be our aim to concentrate, in addition to
      biographical details, many important facts from the testimony
      of antiquarians; for scarcely a volume of the
      <i>Archaeologia</i> has appeared without some valuable
      communication on Caxton and his times.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime we proceed with the <i>locale</i> of Caxton's
      house, situate on the south-west of Westminster Abbey, where
      was formerly the eleemosynary, or almonry, where the alms of
      the abbots were distributed. Howell in his
      <i>Londinopolis</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page378"
      name="page378"></a>[pg 378]</span> describes this as "the
      spot where the abbot of Westminster permitted Caxton to set
      up his press in the <i>Almonry</i>, or Ambry," the former of
      which names is still retained. This is confirmed by Newcourt,
      in his <i>Repertorium</i>, who says, "St. Anne's, an old
      chapel, over against which the Lady Margaret, mother to king
      Henry VII., erected an alms-house for poor women, which is
      now turned into lodgings for singing-men of the college. The
      place wherein this chapel and alms-house stood was called the
      Eleemosinary, or Almonry, now corruptly called the Ambry,
      (Aumbry,) for that the alms of the abbey were there
      distributed to the poor; in which the abbot of Westminster
      erected the first press for book-printing that was in
      England, about the year of Christ 1471, and where WILLIAM
      CAXTON, citizen and mercer of London, who first brought it
      into England, practised it." Here he printed <i>The Game and
      Play of the Chesse</i>, said to be the first book that issued
      from the press in this country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, according to Mr. M'Creery, the intelligent author of
      "The Press," a poem, "the title of <i>chapel</i> to the
      internal regulations of a printing-office originated in
      Caxton's exercising the profession in one of the chapels in
      Westminster Abbey, and may be considered as an additional
      proof, from the antiquity of the custom, of his being the
      first English printer."<a id="footnotetag2"

      Every lover of science, on approaching this spot, will feel
      himself on holy ground, however the idle and incurious of our
      metropolis may neglect the scite, or be ignorant of its
      identity. We are there led into an eternity of reflection and
      association of ideas; but lest human pride should be too
      fondly feasted in the retrospect, the hallowed towers of the
      abbey, seen in the distance, serve to remind us of the
      imperial maxim, that "art is long, and life but short."

    <h3>
      TEA.&mdash;ITS INTRODUCTION INTO ENGLAND.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (A correspondent, who signs <i>M.M.M.</i> informs us that the
      article sent to us by <i>P.T.W</i>. and inserted in No. 280
      of the MIRROR, was copied verbatim from the <i>Imperial
      Magazine</i>, a work which we seldom see, and consequently we
      had no opportunity of ascertaining the origin of our
      correspondent's paper. It seemed to us a good
      <i>cyclopaedian</i> article on the subject, and we
      accordingly admitted it. We now subjoin <i>M.M.M.'s</i>
      communication.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to what has been said in the article upon tea,
      (by <i>P.T.W.</i>) allow me to remark (and which I do not
      recollect ever to have seen noticed in any work upon the
      subject) that the seed is contained in <i>two</i> vessels,
      the outer one varying in shape, triangular, long, and round,
      according to the number which it contains of what may be
      termed inner vessels. The outer vessel of a triangular shape,
      measures, from the base to the apex about three quarters of
      an inch, and is of a dark brown colour, approaching to black,
      and thick, strong, and rough in texture; within this is
      another vessel, containing the kernel; this inner vessel is
      of a light brown colour, thin, and brittle, in shape, seldom
      perfectly round, but mostly flat on one side: there are three
      of them in a triangular seed vessel, two in a long one, and
      one in that which is round. The kernel is of a brown colour,
      and in taste very bitter. In no other species of teas than
      Bohea, is the large kind of seed found, which is probably
      owing to that species being gathered last or in autumn. There
      is a <i>small</i> seed found mixed with the Congou kind of
      teas, about the size of a pea, which is in every respect
      similar to the large, except in size. This seed was evidently
      not permitted to ripen, but the calyx of the flower connected
      with the peduncle is quite perfect. The Twankey species are
      of the same appearance, all of which I have had ample
      opportunity of inspecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an appendage to this note, we are induced to quote the
      following pleasant page from <i>Time's Telescope</i> for
      1828; and we take this opportunity of reminding our readers
      that our customary Supplementary sheet, containing the spirit
      of this and other popular Annual Works will be published with
      our next Number.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a single sheet found in Sir Hans Sloane's library, in
      the British Museum, and printed by Mr. Ellis in his Original
      Letters, <i>Second Series</i>, it appears that tea was known
      in England in the year 1657, though not then in general use.
      The author of this paper says, "That the vertues and
      excellencies of this leaf and drink are many and great, is
      evident and manifest by the high esteem and use of it
      (especially of late years) among the physicians and knowing
      men in France, Italy, Holland, and other parts of
      Christendom; <i>and in</i> ENGLAND it hath been sold in the
      leaf for <i>six pounds</i>, and sometimes for TEN
      <i>pounds</i> the pound weight, and in respect of its former
      scarceness and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page379"
      name="page379"></a>[pg 379]</span> dearness, it hath been
      only used as a regalia in high treatments and entertainments,
      and presents made thereof to princes and grandees, till the
      year 1657."
    </p>
    <p>
      Secretary Pepys, in his Diary, vol. i. p. 76, without saying
      where he had his drink, makes the following
      entry:&mdash;"Sept. 25th, 1660. I did send for a cup of tea
      (a China drink) of which I never had drunk before, and went
      away."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a letter from Mr. Henry Savill to his uncle, Secretary
      Coventry, dated from Paris, Aug. 12, 1678, and printed by Mr.
      Ellis, the writer, after acknowledging the hospitalities of
      his uncle's house, quaintly observes, "These, I hope, are the
      charms that have prevailed with me to remember (that is to
      trouble) you oftener than I am apt to do other of my friends,
      whose buttery-hatch is not so open, <i>and who call for</i>
      TEA instead of pipes and bottles after dinner; <i>a base
      unworthy Indian practice</i>, and which I must ever admire
      your most Christian family for not admitting. The truth is,
      all nations have grown so wicked as to have some of these
      filthy customs." In 1678, the year in which the above letter
      is dated, the East India Company began the importation of tea
      as a branch of trade; the quantity received at that time
      amounting to 4,713 lbs. The importation gradually enlarged,
      and the government, in consequence, augmented the duties upon
      tea. By the year 1700, the importation of tea had arrived at
      the quantity of 20,000 lbs. In 1721, it exceeded a million of
      pounds. In 1816, it had arrived at 86,234,380 lbs. Something
      more than thirty millions of pounds is probably the present
      average of importation: some allowance must be made for tea
      damaged and spoiled upon the passage.&mdash;See more on this
      subject, well worthy of perusal, in Mr. Ellis's Letters,

    </p>
    <p>
      In the yeere 1216, king John was poisoned, as most writers
      testify, at Swinsted Abbey, by a monk of that abbey, of the
      order of Cistersians, or S. Bernard's brethren, called Simon
      of Swinsted. The monk did first consult with his abbot,
      shewing him what he minded to do, alleging for himself the
      prophecy of Caiphas, 11th of John, saying, it is better that
      one man die, than the whole people perish. I am well content,
      saith he, to lose my life, and so become a martyr, that I may
      utterly destroy this tyrant. With that the abbot did weep for
      gladness, and much commended his fervent zeal. The monk then
      being absolved of his abbot for doing this fact, went
      secretly into the garden, on the back side, and finding there
      a most venomous toad, did so prick him and press him with his
      penknife, that hee made him vomite all the poison that was
      within him; this done, he conveyed it into a cup of wine, and
      with a flattering and smiling countenance he sayeth to the
      king, "If it shall please your princely majesty, here is such
      a cup of wine as you never drank better in your lifetime. I
      trust this wassall shall make all England glad," and with
      that he drank a great draught thereof, and the king pledged
      him; the monk then went out of the house to the back, and
      then died, his bowels gushing out of his belly, and had
      continually from henceforth three monks to sing mass for him,
      confirmed by their general charter. The king, within a short
      space after, feeling great grief in his body, asked for
      Simon, the monk; answer was made he was dead. "Then God have
      mercy on me," said the king; so went he to Newark-upon-Trent,
      and there died, and was buried in the cathedral church at
      Worster, in 1216, the 19th day of October, after having been
      much fered with the clergy 18 years, 6 months, and a day.

      LILLIARD EDGE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the border between the parishes of Maxton and Ancrum is
      a bridge, called Lilliard Edge, formerly Anerum moor, where a
      battle was fought between the Scots and English soon after
      the death of king James V., who died in the year 1542. When
      the Earl of Arran was regent of Scotland, Sir Ralph Rivers
      and Sir Bryan Laiton came to Jedburgh with an army of 5,000
      English to seize Merse and Teviotdale in the name of Henry
      VIII., then king of England, who died not long after, in the
      year 1547. The regent and the Earl of Angus came with a small
      body of men to oppose them. The Earl of Angus was greatly
      exasperated against the English, because some time before
      they had defaced the tombs of his ancestors at Melrose, and
      had done much hurt to the abbey there. The regent and the
      Earl of Angus, without waiting the arrival of a greater
      force, which was expected, met the English at Lilliard Edge,
      where the Scots obtained a great victory, considering the
      inequality of their number. A young woman of the name of
      Lilliard fought along with the Scots with great courage; she
      fell in the battle, and a tombstone was erected upon her
      grave on the field where it was fought. Some remains of this
      tombstone are still to be seen. It is said to have contained
      the following inscription:&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          "Fair maiden Lilliard lies under this stane;

        <p>
          Little was her stature, but great was her fame.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the English lads she laid many thumps,
        </p>
        <p>
          And when her legs were off she fought on her stumps."

      BOOKS AND BOOKWORMS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Books were anciently made of plates of copper and lead, the
      bark of trees, bricks, Stones, and wood. Josephus speaks of
      two columns, the one of stone, the other of brick, on which
      the children of Seth wrote their inventions and astronomical
      discoveries. Porphyry mentions some pillars, preserved in
      Crete, on which the ceremonies observed by the Corybantes in
      their sacrifices were recorded. The leaves of the palm-tree
      were used, and the finest and thinnest part of the bark of
      such trees as the lime, the ash, the maple, and the elm; from
      hence comes the word <i>liber</i>, which signifies the inner
      bark of the trees; and as these barks are rolled up, in order
      to be removed with greater ease, these rolls were called
      <i>volumen</i>, a volume, a name afterwards given to the like
      rolls of paper or parchment. By degrees wax, then leather,
      were introduced, especially the skins of goats and sheep, of
      which at length parchment was prepared; also linen, then
      silk, horn, and lastly paper. The rolls or volumes of the
      ancients were composed of several sheets, fastened to each
      other, rolled upon a stick, and were sometimes fifty feet in
      length, and about a yard and a half wide. At first the
      letters were only divided into lines, then into separate
      words, which, by degrees, were noted with accents, and
      distributed by points, and stops into periods, paragraphs,
      chapters, and other divisions. In some countries, as among
      the orientals, the lines began from the right, and ran to the
      left; in others, as in northern and western nations, from the
      left to the right; others, as the Grecians, followed both
      directions alternately, going in the one and returning in the
      other.

      In the Chinese books, the lines run from top to bottom.
      Again, the page in some is entire and uniform; in others,
      divided into columns; in others, distinguished into text and
      notes, either marginal or at the bottom; usually it is
      furnished with signatures and catch-words, also with a
      register to discover whether the book be complete. The
      Mahometans place the name of God at the beginning of all
      their books. The word <i>book</i> is derived from the Saxon
      <i>boc</i>, which comes from the northern <i>buech</i>, of
      <i>buechans</i>, a beech, or <i>service-tree</i>, on the bark
      of which our ancestors used to write. A very large estate was
      given for one on Cosmography by king Alfred. About the year
      1400, they were sold from 10<i>l</i>. to 30<i>l</i>. a piece.
      The first printed one was the Vulgate edition of the Bible,
      1462; the second was <i>Cicero de Officiis</i>, 1466. Leo I.
      ordered 200,000 to be burnt at Constantinople. In the
      suppressed monasteries of France, in 1790, there were found
      4,104,412 volumes; nearly one-half were on theology. The end
      of the book, now denoted by <i>finis</i>, was anciently
      marked with a <b>&lt;</b>, called <i>coronis</i>, and the
      whole frequently washed with an oil drawn from cedar, or
      citron chips strewed between the leaves, to preserve it from
      rotting.

      Thus far books; now for the <i>bookworms</i>. Anthony
      Magliabecchi, the notorious bookworm, was born at Florence in
      1633; his passion for reading induced him to employ every
      moment of his time in improving his mind. By means of an
      astonishing memory and incessant application, he became more
      conversant with literary history than any man of his time,
      and was appointed librarian to the grand duke of Tuscany. He
      has been called a living library. He was a man of a most
      forbidding and savage aspect, and exceedingly
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page381" name="page381"></a>[pg
      381]</span> negligent of his person. He refused to be waited
      upon, and rarely took off his clothes to go to bed. His
      dinner was commonly three hard eggs, with a draught of water.
      He had a small window in his door, through which he could see
      all those who approached him; and if he did not wish for
      their company, he would not admit them. He spent some hours
      in each day at the palace library; but is said never in his
      life to have gone farther from Florence than to Pratz,
      whither he once accompanied Cardinal Norris to see a
      manuscript. He died at the age of 81, in the year 1714. In
      the present age we have <i>bookworms</i>, who wander from one
      bookstall to another, and there devour their daily store of
      knowledge. Others will linger at the tempting window filled
      with the "<i>twopenny</i>," and read all the open pages; then
      pass on to another of the same description, and thus enjoy
      literature by the way of <i>Cheapside</i>.

    <h3>
      ON OATHS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Since lately we have had a great deal of prevarication in our
      courts of justice about receiving the oaths of deists,
      &amp;c., I have thought it meet to furnish the MIRROR with an
      account of the first usage of the words, "So help me God."
      The word oath is a corruption of the Saxon <i>eoth</i>. An
      oath is called corporal, because the person making an
      affidavit lays his hand upon a part of the scriptures.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the conclusion of the oath the above words are used, which
      may perhaps have originated in the very ancient manner of
      trial by battle in this country, when the appellee, laying
      his right hand on the book, takes the appellant by the right
      hand with his left, and maketh oath as follows:&mdash;"Hear
      this, thou who callest thyself <i>John</i> by the name of
      baptism, whom I hold by thy hand, that falsely upon me thou
      hast lied; and for this thou liest, that I who call myself
      <i>Thomas</i> by the name of baptism, did not feloniously
      murder thy father, <i>W.</i> by name, <i>so help me God</i>."
      (Here he kisses the book, and concludes,)&mdash;"And this I
      will defend against thee by my body, as this court shall
      award." And the appellant is thus sworn also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, it may be observed also, the true foundation of the
      word <i>lie</i>, being esteemed still so great an affront
      above all others, as whenever it is pronounced to cause "an
      immediate affray and bloodshed."
    </p>
    <p>
      I have seen people sworn in poetry; and certain it is, that
      in many countries in Europe the making of oaths differs. I
      have some curious specimens of ancient oaths, some in Latin
      prose, others in poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Chief Justice Coke was so strict with regard to the
      receiving of oaths, that when at Cambridge Summer Assizes,
      upon a trial of felony, he said, "in case of trespass,
      although it be only to the value of <i>twopence</i>, no
      evidence shall be given to the jury <i>but upon oath</i>,
      much less where <i>the life of a man is in question</i>." An
      action may be brought on the case upon a man calling another
      a <i>perjured</i> man, because it shall be intended to be
      contrary to his oath in a judicial proceeding.

      ORIGINAL LETTER
    </h3>
    <center>
      <i>From the Younger Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, upon his
      death bed, to the Rev. Dr. W.&mdash;&mdash;</i>.
    </center>
    <p>
      Dear Doctor,&mdash;I always looked upon you as a man of true
      virtue, and know you to be a person of sound understanding;
      for however I may have acted in opposition to the principles
      of religion, or the dictates of reason, I can honestly assure
      you I had always the highest veneration for both. The world
      and I may now shake hands, for I dare affirm that we are
      heartily weary of one another. Oh, doctor, what a prodigal
      have I been of that most valuable of all possessions, time. I
      have squandered it away with a profusion unparalleled; and
      now that the enjoyment of a few days would be worth a
      hecatomb of worlds, I cannot flatter myself with a prospect
      of half a dozen hours. How despicable, my dear friend, is
      that man who never prays to his God but in the time of
      distress. In what manner can he supplicate that omnipotent
      Being in his affliction with reverence, whom in the tide of
      his prosperity he never remembered
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page382" name="page382"></a>[pg
      382]</span> with dread! Don't brand me with infidelity, my
      dear doctor, when I tell you I am almost ashamed to offer up
      my petitions at the throne of grace, or of imploring that
      divine mercy in the next world, which I have so scandalously
      abused in this! Shall ingratitude to man be looked upon as
      the blackest of crimes, and not ingratitude to God? Shall an
      insult offered to the king be looked upon in the most
      offensive light, and yet no notice be taken when the King of
      kings is treated with indignity and disrespect. The
      companions of my former libertinism would scarcely believe
      their eyes, my dear doctor, was you to show them this
      epistle. They would laugh at me as a dreaming enthusiast, or
      pity me as a timorous wretch who was shocked at the
      appearance of futurity. But whoever laughs at me for being
      right, or pities me for being sensible of my errors, is more
      entitled to my compassion than my resentment. A future life
      may very well strike terror into any man who has not acted
      well in this life; and he must have an uncommon share of
      courage indeed who does not shrink at the presence of his
      God. You see, my dear doctor, the apprehension of death will
      soon bring the most profligate to a proper use of their
      understanding. To what a situation am I now reduced? Is this
      odious little hut a suitable lodging for a prince? or is this
      anxiety of my mind becoming the characteristic of a
      Christian? From my rank and fortune I might have expected
      affluence to wait on my life, from my religion and
      understanding, peace to smile upon my end; instead of which I
      am afflicted with poverty, and haunted with remorse, despised
      by my country, and I fear forsaken by my God! There is
      nothing so dangerous, my dear doctor, as extraordinary
      abilities. I cannot be accused of vanity now, by being
      sensible I was once possessed of uncommon qualifications,
      more especially as I sincerely regret that I was ever blest
      with any at all. My rank in life made these accomplishments
      still more conspicuous; and, fascinated with the general
      applause which they procured, I never considered about the
      proper means by which they should be displayed; hence, to
      purchase a smile from a blockhead I despised, have I
      frequently treated the virtuous with disrespect, and sported
      with the Holy Name of heaven to obtain a laugh from a parcel
      of fools, who were entitled to nothing but my contempt. Your
      men of wit, my dear doctor, generally look upon themselves as
      discharged from the duties of religion, and confine the
      doctrines of the Gospel to people of meaner understandings;
      it is a sort of derogation, in their opinion, to comply with
      the rules of Christianity, and reckon that man possessed of a
      narrow genius who studies to be good. What a pity that the
      Holy Writings are not made the criterion of true judgment! or
      that any one should pass for a fine gentleman in this world,
      but he that seems solicitous about his happiness in the next.
      My dear doctor, I am forsaken by all my acquaintance, utterly
      neglected by the friends of my bosom and the dependants of my
      bounty. But no matter; I am not now fit to converse with the
      first, and have no ability to serve the latter. Let me not be
      cast off wholly, however, by the good. Favour me with a
      visit, dear doctor, as soon as possible. Writing to you gives
      me some ease, especially upon a subject I could talk of for
      ever. I am of opinion this is the last visit I shall ever
      solicit from you. My distemper is powerful. Come and pray for
      the departing spirit of the unhappy BUCKINGHAM.

      THE PHANTOM HAND.
    </h3>

    <p>
      In a lonely part of the bleak and rocky coast of Scotland,
      there dwelt a being, who was designated by the few who knew
      and feared him, the Warlock Fisher. He was, in truth, a
      singular and a fearful old man. For years he had followed his
      dangerous occupation alone; adventuring forth in weather
      which appalled the stoutest of the stout hearts that
      occasionally exchanged a word with him, in passing to and fro
      in their mutual employment. Of his name, birth, or descent,
      nothing was known; but the fecundity of conjecture had
      supplied an unfailing stock of <i>materiel</i> on these
      points. Some said he was the devil incarnate; others said he
      was a Dutchman, or some other "far-away foreigner," who had
      fled to these comparative solitudes for shelter, from the
      retribution due to some grievous crime; and all agreed, that
      he was neither a Scot nor a true man. In outward form,
      however, he was still "a model of a man," tall, and
      well-made; though in years, his natural strength was far from
      being abated. His matted black hair, hanging in elf-locks
      about his ears and shoulders, together with the perpetual
      sullenness which seemed native in the expression of features
      neither regular nor pleasing, gave him an appearance
      unendurably disgusting. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page383"
      name="page383"></a>[pg 383]</span> He lived alone, in a hovel
      of his own construction, partially scooped out of a
      rock&mdash;was never known to have suffered a visitor within
      its walls&mdash;to have spoken a kind word, or done a kind
      action. Once, indeed, he performed an act which, in a less
      ominous being, would have been lauded as the extreme of
      heroism. In a dreadfully stormy morning, a fishing-boat was
      seen in great distress, making for the shore&mdash;there were
      a father and two sons in it. The danger became imminent, as
      they neared the rocky promontory of the fisher&mdash;and the
      boat upset. Women and boys were screaming and gesticulating
      from the beach, in all the wild and useless energy of
      despair, but assistance was nowhere to be seen. The father
      and one of the lads disappeared for ever; but the younger boy
      clung, with extraordinary resolution, to the inverted vessel.
      By accident, the Warlock Fisher came to the door of his
      hovel, saw the drowning lad, and plunged instantaneously into
      the sea. For some minutes he was invisible amid the angry
      turmoil; but he swam like an inhabitant of that fearful
      element, and bore the boy in safety to the beach. From
      fatigue or fear, or the effects of both united, the poor lad
      died shortly afterwards; and his grateful relatives
      industriously insisted, that he had been blighted in the
      grasp of his unhallowed rescuer!
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of autumn, the weather frequently becomes so
      broken and stormy in these parts, as to render the sustenance
      derived from fishing extremely precarious. Against this,
      however, the Warlock Fisher was provided; for, caring little
      for weather, and apparently less for life, he went out in all
      seasons, and was known to be absent for days, during the most
      violent storms, when every hope of seeing him again was lost.
      Still nothing harmed him: he came drifting back again, the
      same wayward, unfearing, unhallowed animal. To account for
      this, it was understood that he was in connexion with
      smugglers; that his days of absence were spent in their
      service&mdash;in reconnoitring for their safety, and
      assisting their predations. Whatever of truth there might be
      in this, it was well known that the Warlock Fisher never
      wanted ardent spirits; and so free was he in their use and of
      tobacco, that he has been heard, in a long and dreary
      winter's evening, carolling songs in a strange tongue, with
      all the fervour of an inspired bacchanal. It has been said,
      too, at such times he held strange talk with some who never
      answered, deprecated sights which no one else could see, and
      exhibited the fury of an outrageous maniac.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was towards the close of an autumn day, that a tall young
      man was seen surveying the barren rocks, and apparently
      deserted shores, near the dwelling of the fisher. He wore the
      inquiring aspect of a stranger, and yet his step indicated a
      previous acquaintance with the scene. The sun was flinging
      his boldest radiance on the rolling ocean, as the youth
      ascended the rugged path which led to the Warlock Fisher's
      hut. He surveyed the door for a moment, as if to be certain
      of the spot; and then, with one stroke of his foot, dashed
      the door inwards. It was damp and tenantless. The stranger
      set down his bundle, kindled a fire, and remained in quiet
      possession. In a few hours the fisher returned. He started
      involuntarily at the sight of the intruder, who sprang to his
      feet, ready for any alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What seek you in my hut?" said the Fisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A shelter for the night&mdash;the hawks are out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who directed you to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old acquaintance!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never saw you with my eyes&mdash;shiver me! But never mind,
      you look like the breed&mdash;a ready hand and a light heel,
      ha! All's right&mdash;tap your keg!"
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner said than done. The keg was broached, and a good
      brown basin of double hollands was brimming at the lips of
      the Warlock Fisher. The stranger did himself a similar
      service, and they grew friendly. The fisher could not avoid
      placing his hand before his eyes once or twice, as if wishful
      to avoid the keen gaze of the stranger, who still plied the
      fire with fuel and his host with hollands. Reserve was at
      length annihilated, and the fisher jocularly said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, and so we're old acquaintance, ha?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," said the young man, with another searching glance. "I
      was in doubt at first, but <i>now</i> I'm certain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what's to be done?" said the Fisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An hour after midnight you must put me on board
      &mdash;&mdash;-'s boat, she'll be abroad. They'll run a light
      to the masthead, for which you'll steer. You're a good hand
      at the helm in a dark night and a rough sea," was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How, if I will not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then&mdash;<i>your life or mine!"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      They sprang to their feet simultaneously, and an immediate
      encounter seemed inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Psha!" said the Fisher, sinking on his seat, "what madness
      this is! I was a thought warm with the liquor, and the
      recollections of past times were rising on
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page384" name="page384"></a>[pg
      384]</span> my memory. Think nothing of it. I heard those
      words once before," and he ground his teeth in
      rage&mdash;"Yes, once&mdash;but in a shriller voice than
      your's! Sometimes, too, the bastard rises to my view; and
      then I smite him so&mdash;bah! give us another basin-full!"
      He stuck short at vacancy, snatched the beverage from the
      stranger, and drank it off. "An hour after midnight, said
      ye?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay&mdash;you'll see no bastards then!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Worse&mdash;may be&mdash;worse!" muttered the Fisher,
      sinking into abstraction, and glaring wildly on the
      flickering embers before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, how's this?" said the stranger. "Are your senses
      playing bo-peep with the ghost of some pigeon-livered coast
      captain, eh? Come, take another pull at the keg, to clear
      your head-lights, and tell us a bit of your ditty."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fisher took another draught, and proceeded&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "About five-and-twenty years ago, a stranger came to this
      hut&mdash;may the curse of God annihilate him!&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amen to that," said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He brought with him a boy and a girl, a purse of gold, and
      &mdash;&mdash; the arch fiend's tongue, to tempt me! Well, it
      was to take these children out to sea&mdash;upset the
      boat&mdash;and lose them!"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you did so!" interrupted the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tried&mdash;but listen. On a fine evening, I took them
      out: the sun sunk rapidly, and I knew by the freshening of
      the breeze, there would be a storm. I was not mistaken. It
      came on even faster than I wished. The children were
      alarmed&mdash;the boy, in particular, grew suspicious; he
      insisted that I had an object in going out so far at sun-set.
      This irritated me,&mdash;and I rose to smite him, when the
      fair girl interposed her fragile form between us. She
      screamed for mercy, and clung to my arm with the desperation
      of despair. <i>I could not shake her off</i>! The boy had the
      spirit of a man; he seized a piece of spar, and struck me on
      the temples. 'How, you villain!' said he, 'your life or
      mine!' At that moment the boat upset, and we were all adrift.
      The boy I never saw again&mdash;a tremendous sea broke
      between us&mdash;but the wretched girl clung to me like hate!
      Damnation!&mdash;her dying scream is ringing in my ears like
      madness! I struck her on the forehead, and she sank&mdash;all
      but her hand, one little, white hand would not sink! I threw
      myself on my back, and struck at it with both my
      feet&mdash;and then I thought it sunk for ever. I made the
      shore with difficulty, for I was stunned and senseless, and
      the ocean heaved as if it would have washed away the mortal
      world&mdash;and the lightnings blazed as if all hell had come
      to light the scene of warfare! I have never since been on the
      sea at midnight, but that hand has followed or preceded me; I
      have never &mdash;&mdash;." Here he sank down from his seat,
      and rolled himself in agony upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor wretch!" muttered the stranger, "what hinders now my
      long-sought vengeance? Even with my foot&mdash;but thou shalt
      share my murdered sister's grave!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A shot is fired&mdash;look out for the light!" said the
      young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fisher went to the door; but suddenly started back,
      clasping his hands before his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fire and brimstone! there it is again!" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" said his companion, looking cooly round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That infernal hand! Lightnings blast it!&mdash;but that's
      impossible," he added, in a fearful under-tone, which sounded
      as if some of the eternal rocks around him were adding a
      response to his imprecations&mdash;"<i>that's</i> impossible!
      It is a part of them&mdash;it has been so for
      years&mdash;darkness could not shroud it&mdash;distance could
      not separate it from my burning eye-balls!&mdash;awake, it
      was there&mdash;asleep, it flickered and blazed before
      me!&mdash;it has been my rock a-head through life, and it
      will herald me to hell!" So saying, he pressed his sinewy
      hands upon his face, and buried his head between his knees,
      till the rock beneath him seemed to shake with his
      uncontrollable agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Again it beckons me!" said he, starting up&mdash;"ten
      thousand fires are blazing in my heart&mdash;in my
      brain!&mdash;where, <i>where</i> can I be worse? Fiend, I
      defy thee!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see nothing," said his companion, with unalterable
      composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see nothing!" thundered the Fisher, with mingling
      sarcasm and fury&mdash;"look <i>there</i>." He snatched his
      hand, and pointing steadily into the gloom, again murmured,
      "Look there! look there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the lightning blazed around with appalling
      brilliancy; and the stranger saw a small white hand, pointing
      tremulously upwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw it there," said he, "but it is not <i>hers</i>!
      Infatuated, abandoned villain." he continued, with
      irrepressible energy, "it is not my sister's hand&mdash;no!
      it is the incarnate fiend's who tempted you, and who now
      waves you to perdition&mdash;begone together!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He aimed a dreadful blow at the astonished
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page385" name="page385"></a>[pg
      385]</span> Fisher, who instinctively avoided the stroke.
      Mutually wound up to the highest pitch of anger, they
      grappled each the other's throat, set their feet, and
      strained for the throw, which was inevitably to bury both in
      the wild waves beneath. A faint shriek was heard, and a
      gibbering, as of many voices, came fluttering around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chatter on!" said the Fisher, "he joins you now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Together&mdash;it will be together!" said the stranger, as
      with a last desperate effort he bent his adversary backward
      from the betling cliff. The voice of the Fisher sounded
      hoarsely in execration, as they dashed into the sea together;
      but what he said was drowned in the hoarser murmur of the
      uplashing surge! The body of the stranger was found on the
      next morning, flung far up on the rocky shore&mdash;but that
      of the murderer was gone for ever!
    </p>
    <p>
      The superstitious peasantry of the neighbourhood still
      consider the spot as haunted; and at midnight, when the waves
      dash fitfully against the perilous crags, and the bleak winds
      sweep with long and angry moan around them, they still hear
      the gibbering voices of the fiends, and the mortal
      execrations of the Warlock Fisher!&mdash;but, after that
      fearful night, no man ever saw THE PHANTOM

    <p>
      All the elephants which were exported from Point de Galle
      were caught in ancient, as well as in modern times, in that
      tract of country which extends from Matura to Tangcolle, in
      the south of Ceylon, and which, from its being famous for its
      elephants in his days, is described by Ptolemy in the map he
      made of Ceylon sixteen hundred years ago as the <i>elephantum
      pascua</i>. The trade in elephants from Ceylon, which used to
      be lucrative, is now completely annihilated, in consequence
      of all the petty Rajahs, Foligars, and other chiefs in the
      southern peninsula of India, who used formerly to purchase
      Ceylon elephants as a part of their state, having lost their
      sovereignties, and being therefore no longer required to keep
      up any state of this description. A gentleman who has a
      plantation at Candy, it is understood, recently introduced
      the use of elephants, in ploughing, with great
      advantage.&mdash;<i>Trans. Asiatic Society</i>.

    <p>
      This beautiful and extraordinary animal, or at least one of
      its genus, was first made known to European naturalists by
      Bruce, who received it from his dragoman, whilst consul
      general at Algiers. It is frequently met with in the date
      territories of Africa, where the animals are hunted for their
      skins, which are afterwards sold at Mecca, and then exported
      to India. Bruce kept his animal alive for several months, and
      took a drawing of it in water colours, of the natural size, a
      copy of which, on transparent paper, was clandestinely made
      by his servant. Mr. Brander, into whose hands the
      <i>Fennecus</i> fell after Bruce left Algiers, gave an
      account of it in "Some Swedish Transactions," but refused to
      let the figure be published, the drawing having been unfairly
      obtained.<a id="footnotetag3"
      name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>
      Bruce asserts that this animal is described in many Arabian
      books, under the name of <i>El Fennec</i>, which appellation
      he conceives to be derived from the Greek word for a palm or
      date-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The favourite food of Bruce's Fennec was dates or any sweet
      fruit; but it was also very fond of eggs; when hungry it
      would eat bread, especially with honey or sugar. His
      attention was immediately attracted if a bird flew near him,
      and he would watch it with an eagerness that could hardly be
      diverted from its object; but he was dreadfully afraid of a
      cat. Bruce never heard that he had any voice. During the day
      he was inclined to sleep, but became restless and exceedingly
      unquiet as night came on. The above Fennec was about ten
      inches long, the tail five inches and a quarter, near an inch
      of it on the tip, black. The colour of the body was dirty
      white, bordering on cream colour; the hair on the belly
      rather whiter, softer and longer than on the rest of the
      body. His look was sly and wily; he built his nest on trees,
      and did not burrow in the earth.

    <p>
      Naturalists, especially those of France,
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page386" name="page386"></a>[pg
      386]</span> were long induced to suspect the truth of Bruce's
      description of this animal; but a specimen from the interior
      of Nubia, and preserved in the museum at Frankfort, has
      recently been engraved; and thus the matter nearly settled by
      the animal belonging to the genus <i>Canis</i>, and the sub
      genus <i>Vulpes</i>; the number of teeth and form, being
      precisely the same as the fox, which it also resembles in its
      feet, number of toes, and form of tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the above engraving we are indebted to the Appendix to
      the important and interesting Travels of Messrs. Denham and
      Clapperton. It is therein described as generally of a white
      colour, inclining to straw yellow; above, from the occiput to
      the insertion of the tail it is light rufous brown,
      delicately pencilled with fine black lines, from thinly
      scattered hairs tipped with black; the exterior of the thighs
      is lighter rufous brown; the chin, throat, belly, and
      interior of the thighs and legs are white, or cream colour.
      The nose is pointed, and black at the extremity; above, it is
      covered with very short, whitish hair inclining to rufous,
      with a small irregular rufous spot on each side beneath the
      eyes; the whiskers are black, rather short and scanty; the
      back of the head is pale rufous brown. The ears are very
      large, erect, and pointed, and covered externally with short,
      pale, rufous brown hair; internally, they are thickly fringed
      on the margin with long grayish white hairs, especially in
      front; the rest of the ears, internally, is bare; externally,
      they are folded or plaited at the base. The tail is very
      full, cylindrical, of a rufous brown colour, and pencilled
      with fine black lines like the back. The fur is very soft and
      fine; that on the back, from the back to the insertion of the
      tail, as well as that on the upper part of the shoulder
      before, and nearly the whole of the hinder thigh, is formed
      of tri-coloured hairs, the base of which is of a dark lead
      colour, the middle white, and the extremity light rufous
      brown.

      <i>Uses of Seals</i>.
    </center>
    <p>
      The benefits which the inhabitants of frigid regions derive
      from seals, are far too numerous and diversified to be
      particularized, as they supply them with almost all the
      conveniences of life. We, on the contrary, so persecute this
      animal, as to destroy hundreds of thousands annually, for the
      sake of the pure and transparent oil with which the seal
      abounds; 2ndly, for its tanned skin, which is appropriated to
      various purposes by different modes of preparation; and
      thirdly, we pursue it for its close and dense attire. In the
      common seal, the hair of the adult is of one uniform kind, so
      thickly arranged and imbued with oil, as to effectually
      resist the action of water; while, on the contrary, in the
      antarctic seals the hair is of two kinds: the longest, like
      that of the northern seals; the other, a delicate, soft fur,
      growing between the roots of the former, close to the surface
      of the skin, and not seen externally; and this beautiful fur
      constitutes an article of very increasing importance in
      commerce; but not only does the clothing of the seal vary
      materially in colour, fineness, and commercial situation, in
      the different species, but not less so in the age of the
      animal. The young of most kinds are usually of a very light
      colour, or entirely white, and are altogether destitute of
      true hair, having this substituted by a long and particularly
      soft fur.&mdash;<i>Quarterly Journal</i>.

      <i>Method of cutting Glass</i>.

    <p>
      If a tube, or goblet, or other round glass body is to be cut,
      a line is to be marked with a gun flint having a sharp angle,
      an agate, a diamond, or a file, exactly on the place where it
      is to be cut. A long thread covered with sulphur is then to
      be passed two or three times round the circular line, and to
      be inflamed and burnt; when the glass is well heated some
      drops of cold water are to be thrown on it, when the piece
      will separate in an exact manner, as if cut with scissors. It
      is by this means that glasses are cut circularly into thin
      bands, which may either be separated from, or repose upon
      each other, at pleasure, in the manner of a
      spring&mdash;-<i>From the French</i>.

      A short time since, the entire skeleton of a stag, of very
      large size, was dug up by some labourers, in excavating the
      bed of the river Ouse, near Lewes, in Sussex. The remains
      were found imbedded in a layer of sand, beneath the alluvial
      blue clay, forming the surface of the valley. The horns were
      in the highest state of preservation, and had seven points,
      like the American deer. The greater part of the skeleton was
      destroyed by the carelessness of the workmen; but a portion,
      including the horns, has been preserved in the collection of

      long; for I measured the right side of the under jaw, which I
      found to be 21 feet along the curve; and 4 feet 6 inches
      wide: the others consisted of numerous vertebrae, ribs,
      femoral bones, and toes, all corresponding in size to the
      jaw; there were also some teeth: these, however, were not of
      proportionate magnitude. These remains were discovered, a
      short time since, in the swamp, near Fort Philip; and the
      other parts of the mighty skeleton, are, it is said, in the

    <h3>
      MUNCHAUSEN RIDE THROUGH EDINBURGH.
    </h3>
    <p>
      We were sitting rather negligently on an infernal animal,
      which, up to that day, had seemed quiet as a
      lamb&mdash;kissing our hand to Mrs. Davison, then Miss
      Duncan, and in the blaze of her fame, when a Highland
      regiment, no doubt the forty-second, that had been trudging
      down the Mound, so silently that we never heard them, all at
      once, and without the slightest warning, burst out, with all
      their bag-pipes, into one pibroch! The mare&mdash;to do her
      justice&mdash;had been bred in England, and ridden, as a
      charger, by an adjutant to an English regiment. She was even
      fond of music&mdash;and delighted to prance behind the
      band&mdash;unterrified by cymbals or great drum. She never
      moved in a roar of artillery at reviews&mdash;and, had the
      Castle of Edinburgh&mdash;Lord bless it&mdash;been
      self-involved, at that moment, in a storm of thunder and
      lightning, round its entire circle of cannon, that mare would
      not so much as have pricked up her ears, whisked her tail, or
      lifted a hoof. But the pibroch was more than horse-flesh and
      blood could endure&mdash;and off we two went like a
      whirlwind. Where we went&mdash;that is to say, what were the
      names of the few first streets along which we were borne, is
      a question which, as a man of veracity, we must positively
      decline answering. For some short space of time, lines of
      houses reeled by without a single face at the
      windows&mdash;and these, we have since conjectured, might be
      North and South Hanover street, and Queen-street. By and by
      we surely were in something like a square&mdash;could it be
      Charlotte-square?&mdash;and round and round it we
      flew&mdash;three, four, five, or six times, as horsemen do at
      the Caledonian amphitheatre&mdash;for the animal had got
      blind with terror, and kept viciously reasoning in a circle.
      What a show of faces at all the windows then! A shriek still
      accompanied us as we clattered, and thundered, and lightened
      along; and, unless our ears lied, there were occasional
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page388" name="page388"></a>[pg
      388]</span> fits of stifled laughter, and once or twice a
      guffaw; for there was now a ringing of lost
      stirrups&mdash;and much holding of the mane. One complete
      round was executed by us, first on the shoulder beyond the
      pommel; secondly, on the neck; thirdly, between the ears;
      fourthly, between the forelegs, in a place called the
      counter, with our arms round the jugular veins of the flying
      phenomenon, and our toes in the air. That was, indeed, the
      crisis of our fever, but we made a wonderful recovery back
      into the saddle&mdash;righting like a boat capsized in a
      sudden squall at sea&mdash;and once more, with accelerated
      speed, away past the pillared front of St. George's church!
    </p>
    <p>
      The castle and all its rocks, in peristrephic panorama, then
      floated cloud-like by&mdash;and we saw the whole mile-length
      of Prince's-street stretched before us, studded with
      innumerable coaches, chaises, chariots, carts, wagons, drays,
      gigs, shandrydans, and wheel-barrows, through among which we
      dashed, as if they had been as much gingerbread&mdash;while
      men on horseback were seen flinging themselves off, and
      drivers dismounting in all directions, making their escape up
      flights of steps and common stairs&mdash;mothers or nurses
      with broods of young children flying hither and thither in
      distraction, or standing on the very crown of the causeway,
      wringing their hands in despair. The wheel-barrows were
      easily disposed of&mdash;nor was there much greater
      difficulty with the gigs and shandrydans. But the
      hackney-coaches stood confoundedly in the way&mdash;and a
      wagon, drawn by four horses, and heaped up to the very sky
      with beer-barrels, like the Tower of Babel or Babylon, did
      indeed give us pause&mdash;but ere we had leisure to ruminate
      on the shortness of human life, we broke through between the
      leaders and the wheels with a crash of leathern breeching,
      dismounted collars, riven harness, and tumbling of enormous
      horses that was perilous to hear; when, as Sin and Satan
      would have it&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;there, twenty
      kilts deep at the least, was the same accursed Highland
      regiment, the forty-second, with fixed bayonets, and all its
      pipers in the van, the pibroch yelling, squeaking, squealing,
      grunting, growling, roaring, as if it had only that very
      instant broken out&mdash;so, suddenly to the
      right&mdash;about went the bag-pipe-haunted mare, and away up
      the Mound, past the pictures of Irish Giants&mdash;Female
      Dwarfs&mdash;Albinos&mdash;an Elephant endorsed with
      towers&mdash;Tigers and Lions of all sorts&mdash;and a large
      wooden building, like a pyramid, in which there was the
      thundering of cannon&mdash;for the battle, we rather think,
      of Camperdown was going on&mdash;the Bank of Scotland seemed
      to sink into the NorLoch&mdash;one gleam through the window
      of the eyes of the Director-General&mdash;and to be sure how
      we did make the street-stalls of the Lawn-market spin! The
      man in St. Giles's steeple was playing his one o'clock tune
      on the bells, heedless in that elevation of our
      career&mdash;in less than no time John Knox, preaching from a
      house half-way down the Canongate, gave us the
      go-by&mdash;and down through one long wide sprawl of men,
      women, and children we wheeled past the Gothic front, and
      round the south angle of Holyrood, and across the
      King's-park, where wan and withered sporting debtors held up
      their hands and cried,
      Hurra&mdash;hurra&mdash;hurra&mdash;without stop or stay, up
      the rocky way that leads to St. Anthony's Well and
      Chapel&mdash;and now it was manifest that we were bound for
      the summit of Arthur's Seat. We hope that we were
      sufficiently thankful that a direction was not taken towards
      Salisbury Crags, where we should have been dashed into many
      million pieces. Free now from even the slightest suburban
      impediment, obstacle, or interruption, we began to eye our
      gradually rising situation in life&mdash;and looking over our
      shoulder, the sight of city and sea was indeed magnificent.
      There in the distance rose North Berwick Law&mdash;but though
      we have plenty of time now for description, we had scant time
      then for beholding perhaps the noblest scenery in Scotland.
      Up with us&mdash;up with us into the clouds&mdash;and just as
      St. Giles's bells ceased to jingle, and both girths broke, we
      crowned the summit, and sat on horseback like king Arthur
      himself, eight hundred feet above the level of the sea!

      LELAND.
    </h3>
    <p>
      John Leland, the father of the English antiquaries, was born
      in London, about the end of the reign of Henry VII. He was a
      pupil to William Lily, the celebrated grammarian&mdash;the
      first head master of St. Paul's school; and by the kindness
      and liberality of a Mr. Myles, he was sent to Christ's
      college. Cambridge. From this university he removed to All
      Souls, Oxford, where he paid particular attention to the
      Greek language. He afterwards went to Paris, where he
      cultivated the acquaintance of the principal scholars of the
      age, and could probably number among his correspondents
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page389" name="page389"></a>[pg
      389]</span> the illustrious names of Buddoeus, Erasmus, the
      Stephani, Faber, and Turnebus; in this city he perfected
      himself in the knowledge of the Latin and Greek tongues, to
      which he afterwards added that of several modern languages.
      On his return to England he took orders, and was appointed
      one of the chaplains to Henry VIII., who gave him the rectory
      of Popelay, in the marshes of Calais, appointed him his
      library keeper, and conferred on him the title of Royal
      Antiquary, which no other person in this kingdom, before, or
      after possessed. In this character his majesty in 1533
      granted him a commission, empowering him to search after
      England's antiquities, and peruse the libraries of all
      cathedrals, abbeys, priories, colleges, &amp;c., as also all
      the places wherein records, writings, and whatever else was
      lodged that related to antiquity. "Before Leland's time,"
      says Hearne, in his preface to the <i>Itinerary</i>, "all the
      literary monuments of antiquity were totally disregarded; and
      the students of Germany apprised of this culpable
      indifference, were suffered to enter our libraries
      unmolested, and to cut out of the books deposited there
      whatever passages they thought proper, which they afterwards
      published as relics of the ancient literature of their own
      country."
    </p>
    <p>
      In this research Leland was occupied above six years in
      travelling through England, and in visiting all the remains
      of ancient buildings and monuments of every kind. On its
      completion, he hastened to the metropolis, to lay at the feet
      of his sovereign the result of his labours, which he
      presented to Henry, under the title of a "New Year's
      Gift,"<a id="footnotetag4"
      name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>
      in which he says, "I have so traviled yn your dominions booth
      by the se costes and the midle partes, sparing nother labor
      nor costes, by the space of these vi. yeres paste, that there
      is almoste nother cape, nor bay, haven, creke or peers, river
      or confluence of rivers, breches, watchies, lakes, meres,
      fenny waters, montagnes, valleis, mores, hethes, forestes,
      chases wooddes, cities, burges, castelles, principale manor
      placis, monasteries, and colleges, but I have seene them; and
      notid yn so doing a hole worlde of thinges very memorable."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the dissolution of the monasteries, Leland made
      application to Secretary Cromwell, to entreat his assistance
      in getting the MSS. they contained sent to the king's
      library. In 1542 Henry presented him with the valuable
      rectory of Hasely, in Oxfordshire; the year following he
      preferred him to a canonry of King's college, now
      Christchurch, Oxford, and about the same time collated him to
      a prebend in the church of Sarum. As his duties in the church
      did not require much active service, he retired with his
      collections to his house in London, where he sat about
      digesting them, and preparing the publication he had promised
      to the world; but either his intense application, or some
      other cause, brought upon him a total derangement of mind,
      and after lingering two years in this state, he died on the
      18th of April, 1552.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writings of Leland are numerous; in his lifetime he
      published several Latin and Greek poems, and some tracts on
      antiquarian subjects. His valuable and voluminous MSS., after
      passing through many hands, came into the Bodleian library,
      furnishing very valuable materials to Stow, Lambard, Camden,
      Burton, Dugdale, and many other antiquaries and historians.
      Polydore Virgil, who had stolen from them pretty freely, had
      the insolence to abuse Leland's memory&mdash;calling him "a
      vain glorious man." From these collections Hall published, in
      1709, "Commentarii de Scriptoribus Brittanicis." "The
      Itinerary of John Leland, Antiquary," was published by the
      celebrated Hearne, at Oxford, in nine volumes, 8vo., 1710, of
      which a second edition was printed in 1745, with considerable
      improvements and additions. The same editor published
      "Joannis Lelandi Antiquarii de Rebus Brittanicis
      Collectanea." in six volumes, Oxon. 1716, 8vo.

      CORAL ISLANDS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      [In a recent Number of the MIRROR we quoted from Mr.
      Montgomery's <i>Pelican Island</i> a beautiful description of
      the formation of coral reefs or rocks; and we are now induced
      to resume our extracts from this soul stirring poem, with the
      following description of the process by which these reefs or
      rocks become beautiful and picturesque islands. Mr.
      Montgomery's poetical talent is altogether of the highest
      order, or, to use a familiar phrase, his <i>Pelican
      Island</i> is "a gem of the first water." How exquisite is
      the following picture of creation!]

          Plants of superior growth now sprang apace,

          With moon-like blossoms crown'd, or starry glories;
        </p>
        <p>
          Light flexible shrubs among the greenwood play'd

          Fantastic freaks,&mdash;they crept, they climb'd, they

          And hung their flowers and berries in the sun;

          Their sprays in bowers, or spread the ground with
          net-work.

          Through the slow lapse of undivided time,

          Silently rising from their buried germs,

          Trees lifted to the skies their stately heads,

        <p>
          Tufted with verdure, like depending plumage,
        </p>
        <p>
          O'er stems unknotted, waving to the wind:
        </p>
        <p>
          Of these in graceful form, and simple beauty,

        <p>
          The fruitful cocoa and the fragrant palm

          That stretch'd unwieldy their enormous arms,

        <p>
          Clad with luxuriant foliage, from the trunk,
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the old eagle, feather'd to the heel;
        </p>
        <p>
          While every fibre, from the lowest root
        </p>
        <p>
          To the last leaf upon the topmost twig,

        <p>
          Was held by common sympathy, diffusing

        <p>
          Through all the complex frame unconscious life.

          Such was the locust with its hydra boughs,
        </p>
        <p>
          A hundred heads on one stupendous trunk;
        </p>
        <p>
          And such the mangrove, which, at full-moon flood,
        </p>
        <p>
          Appear'd itself a wood upon the waters,
        </p>
        <p>
          But when the tide left bare its upright roots,
        </p>
        <p>
          A wood on piles suspended in the air;
        </p>
        <p>
          Such too the Indian fig, that built itself
        </p>
        <p>
          Into a sylvan temple, arch'd aloof
        </p>
        <p>
          With airy aisles and living colonnades,
        </p>
        <p>
          Where nations might have worshipp'd God in peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          From year to year their fruits ungather'd fell;
        </p>
        <p>
          Not lost, but quickening where they lay, they struck
        </p>
        <p>
          Root downward, and brake forth on every hand,
        </p>
        <p>
          Till the strong saplings, rank and file, stood up,
        </p>
        <p>
          A mighty army, which o'erran the isle,
        </p>
        <p>
          And changed the wilderness into a forest.
        </p>
        <p>
          All this appear'd accomplish'd in the space
        </p>
        <p>
          Between the morning and the evening star:
        </p>
        <p>
          So, in his third day's work, Jehovah spake,
        </p>
        <p>
          And Earth, an infant, naked as she came
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of the womb of chaos, straight put on
        </p>
        <p>
          Her beautiful attire, and deck'd her robe
        </p>
        <p>
          Of verdure with ten thousand glorious flowers,
        </p>
        <p>
          Exhaling incense; crown'd her mountain-heads
        </p>
        <p>
          With cedars, train'd her vines around their girdles,
        </p>
        <p>
          And pour'd spontaneous harvests at their feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor were those woods without inhabitants
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides the ephemera of earth and air;
        </p>
        <p>

          boughs,
        </p>
        <p>
          And fell like dew-drops on the spangled ground,
        </p>
        <p>
          To light the diamond-beetle on his way;
        </p>
        <p>
          &mdash;Where cheerful openings let the sky look down
        </p>
        <p>
          Into the very heart of solitude,
        </p>
        <p>
          On little garden-pots of social flowers,
        </p>
        <p>
          That crowded from the shades to peep at daylight;
        </p>
        <p>
          &mdash;Or where unpermeable foliage made
        </p>
        <p>
          Midnight at noon, and chill, damp horror reign'd
        </p>
        <p>
          O'er dead, fall'n leaves and slimy funguses;
        </p>
        <p>
          &mdash;Reptiles were quicken'd into various birth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Loathsome, unsightly, swoln to obscene bulk,
        </p>
        <p>
          Lurk'd the dark toad beneath the infected turf;
        </p>
        <p>
          The slow-worm crawl'd, the light cameleon climb'd,
        </p>
        <p>
          And changed his colour as his pace he changed;
        </p>
        <p>
          The nimble lizard ran from bough to bough,
        </p>
        <p>
          Glancing through light, in shadow disappearing;
        </p>
        <p>
          The scorpion, many-eyed, with sting of fire,
        </p>
        <p>
          Bred there,&mdash;the legion-fiend of creeping things;
        </p>
        <p>
          Terribly beautiful, the serpent lay,
        </p>
        <p>
          Wreath'd like a coronet of gold and jewels,
        </p>
        <p>
          Fit for a tyrant's brow; anon he flew
        </p>
        <p>
          Straight as an arrow shot from his own rings,
        </p>
        <p>
          And struck his victim, shrieking ere it went
        </p>
        <p>
          Down his strain'd throat, that open sepulchre.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amphibious monsters haunted the lagoon;
        </p>
        <p>
          The hippopotamus, amidst the flood,
        </p>
        <p>
          Flexile and active as the smallest swimmer;
        </p>
        <p>
          But on the bank, ill balanced and infirm,
        </p>
        <p>
          He grazed the herbage, with huge, head declined,
        </p>
        <p>
          Or lean'd to rest against some ancient tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          The crocodile, the dragon of the waters,
        </p>
        <p>
          In iron panoply, fell as the plague,
        </p>
        <p>
          And merciless as famine, cranch'd his prey,
        </p>
        <p>
          While, from his jaws, with dreadful fangs all serried,
        </p>
        <p>
          The life-blood dyed the waves with deadly streams.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seal and the sea-lion, from the gulf
        </p>
        <p>
          Came forth, and couching with their little ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slept on the shelving rocks that girt the shores,
        </p>
        <p>
          Securing prompt retreat from sudden danger;
        </p>
        <p>
          The pregnant turtle, stealing out at eve,
        </p>
        <p>
          With anxious eye, and trembling heart, explored
        </p>
        <p>
          The loneliest coves, and in the loose warm sand
        </p>
        <p>
          Deposited her eggs, which the sun hatch'd:
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence the young brood, that never knew a parent,
        </p>
        <p>
          Unburrow'd and by instinct sought the sea;
        </p>
        <p>
          Nature herself, with her own gentle hand,
        </p>
        <p>
          Dropping them one by one into the flood,
        </p>
        <p>
          And laughing to behold their antic joy,
        </p>
        <p>
          When launch'd in their maternal element.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vision of that brooding world went on;
        </p>
        <p>
          Millions of beings yet more admirable
        </p>
        <p>
          Than all that went before them now appear'd;
        </p>
        <p>
          Flocking from every point of heaven, and filling
        </p>
        <p>
          Eye, ear, and mind, with objects, sounds, emotions
        </p>
        <p>
          Akin to livelier sympathy and love

          Then, cowering o'er them with expanded wings,

          On loftier branches strain'd their clarion-pipes,

    <h3>
      RAPIDS OF NIAGARA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Rapids begin about half a mile above the cataract; and
      although the breadth of the river might at first make them
      appear of little importance, a nearer inspection will
      convince the stranger of their actual size, and the terrific
      danger of the passage. The inhabitants of the neighbourhood
      regard it as certain death to get once involved in them; and
      that, not merely because all escape from the cataract would
      be hopeless, but because the violent force of the water among
      the rocks in the channel, would instantly dash the bones of a
      man in pieces. Instances are on record of persons being
      carried down by the stream; indeed there was an instance of
      two men carried over in March last; but no one is known to
      have ever survived. Indeed, it is very rare that the bodies
      are found; as the depth of the gulf below the cataract, and
      the tumultuous agitation of the eddies, whirlpools, and
      counter currents, render it difficult for any thing once sunk
      to rise again; while the general course of the water is so
      rapid, that it is soon hurried far down the stream. The large
      logs which are brought down in great numbers during the
      spring, bear sufficient testimony to these remarks. Wild
      ducks, geese, &amp;c. are frequently precipitated over the
      cataract, and generally re-appear either dead, or with their
      legs or wings broken. Some say that water-fowl avoid the
      place when able to escape, but that the ice on the shores of
      the river above often prevents them from obtaining food, and
      that they are carried down from mere inability to fly; while
      others assert that, they are sometimes seen voluntarily
      riding among the rapids, and, after descending half-way down
      the cataract, taking wing, and returning to repeat their
      dangerous amusement.&mdash;<i>American Work</i>.

      TRAVELLING.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sterne pitied the man who could travel from Dan to Beersheba,
      and say all "was barren:" however delighted travellers or
      tourists may be on their journey, it is surprising how few
      details are preserved in their memory. This occasioned Dr.
      Johnson to remark, in his "Tour to the Hebrides," how much
      the lapse even "of a few hours takes from the certainty of
      knowledge, and the distinctness
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page392" name="page392"></a>[pg
      392]</span> of imagery;" and that "those who trust to memory
      what cannot be safely trusted but to the eye, must tell by
      guess, what a few hours before they had known with
      certainty." We were never more convinced of the importance of
      these observations than after our first visit to the
      dock-yard, at Portsmouth. In collating some little memoranda
      made on the spot, we referred to our party, (<i>seven</i> in
      number) on our return to the inn, for the <i>extent</i> of
      the dock-yard: not one of them could give a correct answer,
      though all had just heard it detailed and explained with
      accuracy. Dr. Kitchener may well recommend tourists to walk
      about with note-books in their hands! and such inadvertence
      as the preceding almost warrants the oddity of his
      suggestion.

      MALARIA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Dr. Gregory, father of the late celebrated professor in
      Edinburgh, when a student in a part of Germany where
      <i>malaria</i> prevailed, from being a philosopher and living
      low, <i>drinking only water</i>, was seized with intermittent
      fever, when his jolly companions, who ate and drank freely,
      escaped. If brandy or other stimulants are taken previous to
      exposure to malaria, intermittent fever is generally
      prevented. Such are the opinions of the doctor, and if Dr.
      Macculloch be right, we suggest the establishment of a brandy
      vault at each angle of the parks, that every passenger may
      prepare himself.

      LORD HOWE.

    <p>
      When the late Lord Howe was a captain, a lieutenant, not
      remarkable for courage or presence of mind in dangers (common
      fame had brought some imputation upon his character) ran to
      the great cabin and informed his commander that the ship was
      on fire near the gun-room. Soon after this he returned
      exclaiming, "You need not be afraid as the fire is
      extinguished." "<i>Afraid!</i>" replied Captain H. a little
      nettled, "how does a man <i>feel</i>, Sir, when he is afraid?
      I need not ask how he <i>looks</i>."

      BACKGAMMON BOARDS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      We frequently find backgammon boards with backs lettered as
      if they were two folio volumes. The origin of it was thus;
      Eudes, bishop of Sully, forbade his clergy to play at chess.
      As they were resolved not to obey the commandment, and yet
      dared not have a chess-board seen in their houses or
      cloisters, they had them bound and lettered as books, and
      played at night, before they went to bed, instead of reading
      the New Testament or the Lives of the Saints; and the monks
      called the draft or chess-board their <i>wooden gospels</i>.
      They had also drinking vessels bound to resemble the
      breviary, and were found drinking, when it was supposed they
      were at prayer.&mdash;<i>Literary Gazette</i>.

      LOVE OF THE COUNTRY.

    <p>
      Country people will tell you that they like the country, and
      detest the town, although their enjoyments are of a kind
      which may be obtained in far greater perfection in the latter
      than in the former. The only person I ever knew who was
      honest in this respect, was a gentleman, the possessor of a
      beautiful seat, in a beautiful country, when he avowed his
      opinion, that there was "no garden like Covent-garden, and no

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
